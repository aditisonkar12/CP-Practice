## [A. Watermelon](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A)

One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that, the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed `w` kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry. However, they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, so they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs an even number of kilos. It is **not necessary** that the parts are equal. Each of them should get a part of **positive weight**.

Help them determine if they can divide the watermelon the way they want.

### Input:
The first (and only) line contains an integer number `w` (1 ≤ `w` ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

---

### Output:
Print `YES` if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing an even number of kilos; and `NO` otherwise.

---

### Example:
**Input:**  
8  

**Output:**  
YES

### Note:
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).
