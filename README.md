# CP-Practice

Hey! ðŸ‘‹  
I am starting my **Competitive Programming** journey, following the [**TLE Eliminators CP Sheet**](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet), which includes **Codeforces** questions of all ratings. I will also solve problems topic wise following [**Strivers CP Sheet**](https://takeuforward.org/interview-experience/strivers-cp-sheet) as well, according to my learnings.
I will also try to solve problems on **CodeChef** (which are not included in the sheets).  

My goal is to solve **at least 1 problem every day** to steadily improve my CP skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Repository Structure
Each problem folder includes:
- A **README.md** file containing the problem statement and a brief explanation.
- A **C++ solution file** showing my approach to solving the problem.

If you happen to come across this repository, I hope you find these solutions helpful as a reference for your own learning. ðŸš€
